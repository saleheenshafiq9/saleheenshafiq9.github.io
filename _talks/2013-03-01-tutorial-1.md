I was invited to promote ITverse 2023 as the President of IIT Software Engineers' Community in a show at Jamuna TV, which is one of the top news channel in Bangladesh.

I led the biggest national software engineering event in Bangladesh with a team of 79 volunteers, which brought the country's top minds to tackle socio-technical challenges.
