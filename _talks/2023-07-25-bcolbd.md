Our team "Pharmars" have been crowned champions and awarded the prestigious "Professor Jamilur Reza Chowdhury Championship Award" in Bangladesh Blockchain Olympiad 2023.

Our solution was to provide transparency while safeguarding trade secracy in pharmaceutical supply chain sector using decentralized hybrid blockchain.

A shout-out to my teammates for their extraordinary efforts and we hope to continue our journey in this year's International Blockchain Olympiad (IBCOL-2023) as well. Keep us in your prayers.
