Thank you BSMRU Computer and Programming Club - BCPC for the invitation. It was a great experience for me to take the seminar and interact with students.

On this seminar, I discussed the growing software industry in Bangladesh, focusing on career opportunities, industry trends, and essential skills for success. It covered emerging technologies, research fields in R&D centers, and how students can align their education with industry demands to build successful careers in tech.
