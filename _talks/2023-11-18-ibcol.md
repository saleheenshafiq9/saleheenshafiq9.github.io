In 2023, our project, PharmaSync, won the Award of Distinction in the International Blockchain Olympiad, held in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 

It was a team project to enhance trade secrecy and transparency in the pharmaceutical supply chain using a public-permissioned blockchain. To optimize transparency and trade secrecy, we used ZK proofs and Hedera Hashgraph.
