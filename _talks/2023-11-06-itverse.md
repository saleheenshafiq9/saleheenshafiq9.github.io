It has been an honour to serve as the President of the community and be part of something so big. Thanks to everyone who has contributed in making it a success.

ITverse 2023 was a national-level IT fest where students from over 75 universities participated in different segments and showcased their skills. It was organized by IIT Software Engineers' Community and one of the biggest events of the year. 

It has been a long journey and these bunch of people did amazing stuff altogether.
