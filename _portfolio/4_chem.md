Chemoflouge: An AR-based Chemistry Learning App revolutionizes how students engage with complex chemical concepts by integrating augmented reality (AR) into learning. Traditional chemistry education often relies on textbooks and 2D representations that can make understanding molecular structures and reactions challenging. Chemoflouge addresses this by providing an interactive platform where students visualize 3D models, simulate reactions, and explore structures in real time.

The app uses AR technology to overlay chemical models onto real-world spaces, allowing learners to manipulate and interact with them via mobile devices. This hands-on approach bridges the gap between theory and practical visualization. Features include guided tutorials, interactive quizzes, and collaborative learning modes to enhance individual learning and teamwork.
