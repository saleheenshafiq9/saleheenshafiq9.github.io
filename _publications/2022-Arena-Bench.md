excerpt: 'This paper examines the impact of Generative AI tools on Bangladesh's software industry, focusing on their influence on software processes, practitioner perceptions, and job dynamics, while contrasting adoption challenges and opportunities between the Global South and the West. It provides tools to design and generate highly dynamic evaluation worlds, scenarios, and tasks for autonomous navigation and is fully integrated into the robot operating system. To demonstrate the functionalities of our suite, we trained a DRL agent on our platform and compared it against a variety of existing different model-based and learning-based navigation approaches on a variety of relevant metrics. Finally, we deployed the approaches towards real robots and demonstrated the reproducibility of the results.'
