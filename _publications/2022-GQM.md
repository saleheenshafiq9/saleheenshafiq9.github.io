excerpt: >
  In this project, we used Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach in the research methodology. We automated data collection and analysis using structured questionnaires and statistical tests. We extended the analysis to cover a broad range of metrics, including student satisfaction, project difficulty, and the relevance of web technologies in SPL-2. We visualized charts & tables for clearer interpretation.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of the course sequence between the Web Technology course and Software Project Lab 2 (SPL-2) for software engineering students at the Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka. Using the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) model, we aimed to determine whether prior exposure to web technologies before starting SPL-2 improves project outcomes. A structured survey was conducted among current students and alumni, focusing on various project aspects, including development challenges, learning durations, and tool familiarity. The data, analyzed through statistical methods such as the Chi-square test, indicated that most respondents found it challenging to undertake SPL-2 without prior knowledge from the Web Technology course. The majority agreed that taking the Web Technology course beforehand would have enhanced their learning curve and project performance. Thus, we recommend a curriculum adjustment to introduce the Web Technology course before SPL-2 to better equip students for practical projects.
