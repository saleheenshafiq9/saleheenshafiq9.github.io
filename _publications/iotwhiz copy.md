This paper explores the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools in the software industry of Bangladesh through the lenses of data-colonialism and postcolonial computing. While the West has extensively explored various dimensions of these tools, their effects on the Global South remain largely underexplored. Based on our ethnography-inspired qualitative study with software practitioners in Bangladesh, this paper highlights the impact of popular GAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, CodeWhisperer) on the software industry in the Global South. We investigate the impact of GAI tools on four fundamental software process activities: specification, development, validation, and evolution; assess local practitioners' perceptions of future adoption of these tools, and examine the evolving job landscape. Our findings reveal how company maturity influences AI tool adoption and how concerns such as data security, investment readiness for in-house AI solutions, stakeholder protection, and policy awareness may differ between the West and the Global South.This paper explores the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools in the software industry of Bangladesh through the lenses of data-colonialism and postcolonial computing.
