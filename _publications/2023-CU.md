The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) report for the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system of Chittagong University (CU) provides an extensive analysis aimed at automating the university’s academic and administrative processes. Conducted by a requirements engineering team from the Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka, the report outlines the limitations of CU's current manual system, which struggles with inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, and security vulnerabilities due to its expansive and dynamic nature.

The proposed ERP system seeks to address these issues by integrating automated solutions for essential processes such as student admissions, exam management, course scheduling, faculty management, and administrative tasks involving the registrar and vice-chancellor’s offices. Key objectives include enhancing data accuracy, improving communication, streamlining decision-making processes, and maintaining secure data handling practices.

The report highlights the methodology undertaken for this comprehensive analysis, which included stakeholder communications, field visits, and domain problem analysis to understand existing workflows. The proposed solution architecture features modular designs aimed at adaptability and scalability, including components like digital document handling, automated appointment scheduling, electronic ledger maintenance, and integrated payment systems.

Overall, the report underscores the transformative potential of the ERP system to modernize CU’s operations by ensuring greater efficiency, reliability, and seamless interaction across academic and administrative departments.
