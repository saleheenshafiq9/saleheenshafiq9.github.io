![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](/images/home.png){: .align-right width="200px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh.

🔐 My research focuses on software security and privacy, integrating human factors to develop systems that are both reliable and accessible.

📚 I am a prospective PhD student for Fall 2025.

🤖 I’m also curious about the evolving landscape of Generative AI, the challenges and risks tied to its adoption, and how it shapes the future of technology.

# Selected Experience

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Software Engineer ![Samsung](/images/samsung.png){: .align-right width="100px"}
Currently I am working in the **SmartThings** team.

Additionally, I have contributed to **Research and Innovation** by building PoCs for generative AI, UWB/BLE, and AR/VR-related solutions.

## 📜 Research Intern ![William & Mary](/images/william-and-mary.png){: .align-right width="100px"}
I worked on a remote position in the [Secured Platforms Lab](https://spl-wm.github.io/) at William & Mary, VA under the supervision of [Dr. Adwait Nadkarni](https://www.adwaitnadkarni.com/).

I developed [IoTWhiz](https://github.com/saleheenshafiq9/IoTWhiz), a tool for analyzing and characterizing IoT and non-IoT Android applications.
