👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh.

🔐 My research focuses on software security and privacy, integrating human factors to develop systems that are both reliable and accessible.

🤖 I'm also curious about the evolving landscape of Generative AI, the challenges and risks tied to its adoption, and how it shapes the future of technology.

📚 I'm a prospective PhD student for Fall 2025.
